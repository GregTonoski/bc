# Development

This document is meant for the day when I (Gavin D. Howard) get [hit by a
bus][1]. In other words, it's meant to make the [bus factor][1] a non-issue.

This document is supposed to contain all of the knowledge necessary to develop
`bc` and `dc`.

This document will reference other parts of the repository. That is so a lot of
the documentation can be closest to the part of the repo where it is actually
necessary.

## What Is It?

This repository contains an implementation of both [POSIX `bc`][2] and [Unix
`dc`][3].

POSIX `bc` is a standard utility required for POSIX systems. `dc` is a
historical utility that was included in early Unix and even predates both Unix
and C. They both are
arbitrary-precision command-line calculators with their own programming
languages. `bc`'s language looks similar to C, with infix notation and includes
functions, while `dc` uses [Reverse Polish Notation][4] and allows the user to
execute strings as though they were functions.

In addition, it is also possible to build the arbitrary-precision math into a
library, named `bcl`.

**Note**: for ease, I will refer to both programs as `bc` in this document.
However, if I say "just `bc`," I am referring to just `bc`, and if I say `dc`, I
am referring to just `dc`.

## History

This project started in January 2018 when a certain individual on IRC, hearing
that I knew how to write parsers, asked me to write a `bc` parser for his math
library. I did so. I thought about writing my own math library, but he
disparaged my programming skills and made me think that I couldn't do it.

However, he took so long to do it that I eventually decided to give it a try and
had a working math portion in two weeks. It taught me that I should not listen
to such people.

From that point, I decided to make it an extreme learning experience about how
to write quality software.

That individual's main goal had been to get his `bc` into [toybox][16], and I
managed to get my own `bc` in. I also got it in [busybox][17].

Eventually, in late 2018, I also decided to try my hand at implementing
[Karatsuba multiplication][18], an algorithm that that unnamed individual
claimed I could never implement. It took me a bit, but I did it.

This project became a passion project for me, and I continued. In mid-2019,
Stefan EÃŸer suggested I improve performance by putting more than 1 digit in each
section of the numbers. After I showed immaturity because of some burnout, I
implemented his suggestion, and the results were incredible.

Since that time, I have gradually been improving the `bc` as I have learned more
about things like fuzzing, [`scan-build`][19], [valgrind][20],
[AddressSanitizer][21] (and the other sanitizers), and many other things.

One of my happiest moments was when my `bc` was made the default in FreeBSD.

But since I believe in [finishing the software I write][22], I have done less
work on `bc` over time, though there are still times when I put a lot of effort
in, such as now (17 June 2021), when I am attempting to convince OpenBSD to use
my `bc`.

And that is why I am writing this document: someday, someone else is going to
want to change my code, and this document is my attempt to make it as simple as
possible.

## Values

[According to Bryan Cantrill][10], all software has values. I think he's
correct, though I [added one value for programming languages in particular][11].

However, for `bc`, his original list will do:

* Approachability
* Availability
* Compatibility
* Composability
* Debuggability
* Expressiveness
* Extensibility
* Interoperability
* Integrity
* Maintainability
* Measurability
* Operability
* Performance
* Portability
* Resiliency
* Rigor
* Robustness
* Safety
* Security
* Simplicity
* Stability
* Thoroughness
* Transparency
* Velocity

There are several values that don't apply. The reason they don't apply is
because `bc` and `dc` are existing utilities; this is just another
reimplementation. The designs of `bc` and `dc` are set in stone; there is
nothing we can do to change them, so let's get rid of those values that would
apply to their design:

* Compatibility
* Integrity
* Maintainability
* Measurability
* Performance
* Portability
* Resiliency
* Rigor
* Robustness
* Safety
* Security
* Simplicity
* Stability
* Thoroughness
* Transparency

Furthermore, some of the remaining ones don't matter to me, so let me get rid of
those and order the rest according to my *actual* values for this project:

* Robustness
* Stability
* Portability
* Compatibility
* Performance
* Security
* Simplicity

First is **robustness**. This `bc` and `dc` should be robust, accepting any
input, never crashing, and instead, returning an error.

Closely related to that is **stability**. The execution of `bc` and `dc` should
be deterministic and never change for the same inputs, including the
pseudo-random number generator (for the same seed).

Third is **portability**. These programs should run everywhere that POSIX
exists, as well as Windows. This means that just about every person on the
planet will have access to these programs.

Next is **compatibility**. These programs should, as much as possible, be
compatible with other existing implementations and standards.

Then we come to **performance**. A calculator is only usable if it's fast, so
these programs should run as fast as possible.

After that is **security**. These programs should *never* be the reason a user's
computer is compromised.

And finally, **simplicity**. Where possible, the code should be simple, while
deferring to the above values.

Keep these values in mind for the rest of this document, and for exploring any
other part of this repo.

But before I go on, I want to talk about portability in particular.

Most of these principles just require good attention and care, but portability
is different. Sometimes, it requires pulling in code from other places and
adapting it. In other words, sometimes I need to duplicate and adapt code.

This happened in a few cases:

* Option parsing (see [`include/opt.h`][35]).
* History (see [`include/history.h`][36]).
* Pseudo-Random Number Generator (see [`include/rand.h`][37]).

This was done because I decided to ensure that `bc`'s dependencies were
basically zero. In particular, either users have a normal install of Windows or
they have a POSIX system.

A POSIX system limited me to C99, `sh`, and zero external dependencies. That
last item is why I pull code into `bc`: if I pull it in, it's not an external
dependency.

That's why `bc` has duplicated code. Remove it, and you risk `bc` not being
portable to some platforms.

## Code Style

TODO

The code style for `bc` is...weird, and that comes from historical accident.

In [History][23], I mentioned how I got my `bc` in toybox. Well, in order to do
that, my `bc` originally had toybox style. Eventually, I changed to using tabs,
and assuming they were 4 spaces wide, but other than that, I basically kept the
same style, with some exceptions that are more or less dependent on my taste.

The code style is as follows:

* Tabs are 4 spaces.
* Tabs are used at the beginning of lines for indent.
* Spaces are used for alignment.
* Lines are limited to 80 characters, period.
* The opening brace is put on the same line as the header for the function,
  loop, or `if` statement.
* Unless the header is more than one line, in which case the opening brace is
  put on its own line.
* If the opening brace is put on its own line, there is no blank line after it.
* If the opening brace is *not* put on its own line, there *is* a blank line
  after it, *unless* the block is only one or two lines long.
* Code lines are grouped into what I call "paragraphs." Basically, lines that
  seem like they should go together are grouped together. This one comes down
  to judgment.
* Bodies of `if` statements, `else` statements, and loops that are one line
  long are put on the same line as the statement, unless the header is more than
  one line long, and/or, the body cannot fit into 80 characters.
* If single-line bodies are on a separate line from their headers, and the
  headers are only a single line, then no braces are used.
* However, braces are *always* used if they contain another `if` statement or
  loop.
* Loops with empty bodies are ended with a semicolon.
* Expressions that return a boolean value are surrounded by paretheses.
* Macro backslashes are aligned as far to the left as possible.
* Binary operators have spaces on both sides.
* If a line with binary operators overflows 80 character, a newline is inserted
  *after* binary operators.
* Function modifiers and return types are on the same line as the function name.
* With one exception, `goto`'s are only used to jump to the end of a function
  for cleanup.

### ClangFormat

I attempted twice to use [ClangFormat][24] to impose a standard, machine-useful
style on `bc`. Both failed. Otherwise, the style in this repo would be more
consistent.

## Repo Structure

Functions are documented with Doxygen-style doc comments. Functions that appear
in headers are documented in the headers, while static functions are documented
where they are defined.

### `bcl.sln`

A Visual Studio solution file for `bcl`. This, along with [`bcl.vcxproj`][63]
and [`bcl.vcxproj.filters`][64] is what makes it possible to build `bcl` on
Windows.

### `bcl.vcxproj`

A Visual Studio project file for `bcl`. This, along with [`bcl.sln`][65] and
[`bcl.vcxproj.filters`][64] is what makes it possible to build `bcl` on Windows.

### `bcl.vcxproj.filters`

A Visual Studio filters file for `bcl`. This, along with [`bcl.sln`][65] and
[`bcl.vcxproj`][63] is what makes it possible to build `bcl` on Windows.

### `bc.sln`

A Visual Studio solution file for `bc`. This, along with [`bc.vcxproj`][66]
and [`bc.vcxproj.filters`][67] is what makes it possible to build `bc` on
Windows.

### `bc.vcxproj`

A Visual Studio project file for `bcl`. This, along with [`bc.sln`][68] and
[`bc.vcxproj.filters`][67] is what makes it possible to build `bc` on Windows.

### `bc.vcxproj.filters`

A Visual Studio filters file for `bc`. This, along with [`bc.sln`][68] and
[`bc.vcxproj`][66] is what makes it possible to build `bc` on Windows.

### `configure`

A symlink to [`configure.sh`][69].

### `configure.sh`

This is the script to configure `bc` and `bcl` for building.

This `bc` has a custom build system. The reason for this is because of
*portability*.

If `bc` used an outside build system, that build system would be an external
dependency. Thus, I had to write a build system for `bc` that used nothing but
C99 and POSIX utilities.

One of those utilities is POSIX `sh`, which technically implements a
Turing-complete programming language. It's a terrible one, but it works.

A user that wants to build `bc` on a POSIX system (not Windows) first runs
`configure.sh` with the options he wants. `configure.sh` uses those options and
the `Makefile` template ([`Makefile.in`][70]) to generate an actual valid
`Makefile`. Then `make` can do the rest.

For more information about the build process, see the [build manual][14].

For more information about shell scripts, see [POSIX Shell Scripts][76].

`configure.sh` does the following:

1.	It processes command-line arguments and figure out what the user wants to
	build.
2.	It reads in [`Makefile.in`][70].
3.	One-by-one, it replaces placeholders (in [`Makefile.in`][70]) of the form
	`%%<placeholder_name>%%` based on the build type.
4.	It appends a list of file targets based on the build type.
5.	It appends the correct test targets.
6.	It copies the correct manpage and markdown manual for `bc` and `dc` into a
	location from which they can be copied for install.
7.	It does a `make clean` to reset the build state.

### `.gitattributes`

A `.gitattributes` file. This is needed to preserve the `crlf` line endings in
the Visual Studio files.

### `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore`

### `LICENSE.md`

This is the `LICENSE` file, including the licenses of various software that I
have borrowed.

### `Makefile.in`

This is the `Makefile` template for [`configure.sh`][69] to use for generating a
`Makefile`.

For more information, see [`configure.sh`][69] and the [build manual][14].

Because of portability, the generated `Makefile.in` should be a pure [POSIX
`make`][74]-compatible `Makefile` (minus the placeholders). Here are a few
snares for the unwary programmer in this file:

1.	No extensions allowed, including and especially GNU extensions.
2.	If new headers are added, they must also be added to `Makefile.in`.
3.	Don't delete the `.POSIX:` empty target at the top; that's what tells `make`
	implementations that pure [POSIX `make`][74] is needed.

In particular, there is no way to set up variables other than the `=` operator.
There are no conditionals, so all of the conditional stuff must be in
[`configure.sh`][69]. This is, in fact, why [`configure.sh`][69] exists in the
first place: [POSIX `make`][74] is barebones and only does a build with no
configuration.

### `NEWS.md`

A running changelog with an entry for each version. This should be updated at
the same time that [`include/version.h`][75] is.

### `NOTICE.md`

The `NOTICE` file with proper attributions.

### `README.md`

The `README`. Read it.

### `gen/`

A folder containing the files necessary to generate C strings that will be
embedded in the executable.

All of the files in this folder have license headers, but the program and script
that can generate strings from them include code to strip the license header out
before strings are generated.

#### `bc_help.txt`

A text file containing the text displayed for `bc -h` or `bc --help`.

This text just contains the command-line options and a short summary of the
differences from GNU and BSD `bc`'s. It also directs users to the manpage.

The reason for this is because otherwise, the help would be far too long to be
useful.

#### `dc_help.txt`

A text file containing the text displayed for `dc -h` or `dc --help`.

This text just contains the command-line options and a short summary of the
differences from GNU and BSD `dc`'s. It also directs users to the manpage.

The reason for this is because otherwise, the help would be far too long to be
useful.

#### `lib.bc`

A `bc` script containing the [standard math library][5] required by POSIX. See
the [POSIX standard][6] for what is required.

This file does not have any extraneous whitespace, except for tabs at the
beginning of lines. That is because this data goes directly into the binary,
and whitespace is extra bytes in the binary. Thus, not having any extra
whitespace shrinks the resulting binary.

However, tabs at the beginning of lines are kept for two reasons:

1.	Readability. (This file is still code.)
2.	The program and script that generate strings from this file can remove
	tabs at the beginning of lines.

For more details about the algorithms used, see the [algorithms manual][25].

However, there are a few snares for unwary programmers.

First, all constants must be one digit. This is because otherwise, multi-digit
constants could be interpreted wrongly if the user uses a different `ibase`.
This does not happen with single-digit numbers because they are guaranteed to be
interpreted what number they would be if the `ibase` was as high as possible.

This is why `A` is used in the library instead of `10`, and things like `2*9*A`
for `180` in [`lib2.bc`][26].

As an alternative, you can set `ibase` in the function, but if you do, make sure
to set it with a single-digit number and beware the snare below...

Second, `scale`, `ibase`, and `obase` must be safely restored before returning
from any function in the library. This is because without the `-g` option,
functions are allowed to change any of the globals.

Third, all local variables in a function must be declared in an `auto` statement
before doing anything else. This includes arrays. However, function parameters
are considered predeclared.

Fourth, and this is only a snare for `lib.bc`, not [`lib2.bc`][26], the code
must not use *any* extensions. It has to work when users use the `-s` or `-w`
flags.

#### `lib2.bc`

A `bc` script containing the [extended math library][7].

Like [`lib.bc`][8], and for the same reasons, this file should have no
extraneous whitespace, except for tabs at the beginning of lines.

For more details about the algorithms used, see the [algorithms manual][25].

Also, be sure to check [`lib.bc`][8] for the snares that can trip up unwary
programmers when writing code for `lib2.bc`.

#### `strgen.c`

Code for the program to generate C strings from text files. This is the original
program, although [`strgen.sh`][9] was added later.

The reason I used C here is because even though I knew `sh` would be available
(it must be available to run `configure.sh`), I didn't know how to do what I
needed to do with POSIX utilities and `sh`.

Later, [`strgen.sh`][9] was contributed by Stefan EÃŸer of FreeBSD, showing that
it *could* be done with `sh` and POSIX utilities.

However, `strgen.c` exists *still* exists because the versions generated by
[`strgen.sh`][9] may technically hit an environmental limit. (See the [draft C99
standard][12], page 21.) This is because [`strgen.sh`][9] generates string
literals, and in C99, string literals can be limited to 4095 characters, and
`gen/lib2.bc` is above that.

Fortunately, the limit for "objects," which include `char` arrays, is much
bigger: 65535 bytes, so that's what `strgen.c` generates.

However, the existence of `strgen.c` does come with a cost: the build needs C99
compiler that targets the host machine. For more information, see the ["Cross
Compiling" section][13] of the [build manual][14].

Read the comments in `strgen.c` for more detail about it, the arguments it
takes, and how it works.

#### `strgen.sh`

An `sh` script that will generate C strings that uses only POSIX utilities. This
exists for those situations where a host C99 compiler is not available, and the
environment limits mentioned above in [`strgen.c`][15] don't matter.

`strgen.sh` takes the same arguments as [`strgen.c`][15], and the arguments mean
the exact same things, so see the comments in [`strgen.c`][15] for more detail
about that, and see the comments in `strgen.sh` for more details about it and
how it works.

For more information about shell scripts, see [POSIX Shell Scripts][76].

### `include/`

A folder containing the headers.

The headers are not included among the source code because I like it better that
way. Also there were folders within `src/` at one point, and I did not want to
see `#include "../some_header.h"` or things like that.

So all headers are here, even though only one (`bcl.h`) is meant for end users
(to be installed in `INCLUDEDIR`).

#### `args.h`

This file is the API for processing command-line arguments.

#### `bc.h`

This header is the API for `bc`-only items. This includes the `bc_main()`
function and the `bc`-specific lexing and parsing items.

The `bc` parser is perhaps the most sensitive part of the entire codebase. See
the documentation in `bc.h` for more information.

The code associated with this header is in [`src/bc.c`][40],
[`src/bc_lex.c`][41], and [`src/bc_parse.c`][42].

#### `bcl.h`

This header is the API for the `bcl` library.

This header is meant for distribution to end users and contains the API that end
users of `bcl` can use in their own software.

The code associated with this header is in [`src/library.c`][43].

#### `dc.h`

This header is the API for `dc`-only items. This includes the `dc_main()`
function and the `dc`-specific lexing and parsing items.

The code associated with this header is in [`src/dc.c`][44],
[`src/dc_lex.c`][45], and [`src/dc_parse.c`][46].

#### `file.h`

This header is for `bc`'s internal buffered I/O API.

Why did I implement my own buffered I/O for `bc`? Because I use `setjmp()` and
`longjmp()` for error handling, and the buffered I/O in `libc` does not interact
well with the use of those procedures.

For more information about `bc`'s error handling and custom buffered I/O, see
[`vm.h`][27] and the notes about version [`3.0.0`][32] in the [`NEWS`][32].

The code associated with this header is in [`src/file.c`][47].

#### `history.h`

This header is for `bc`'s implementation of command-line editing/history, which
is based on a [UTF-8-aware fork][28] of [`linenoise`][29].

The code associated with this header is in [`src/history.c`][48].

#### `lang.h`

This header defines the data structures and bytecode used for actual execution
of `bc` and `dc` code.

Yes, it's misnamed; that's an accident of history where the first things I put
into it all seemed related to the `bc` language.

The code associated with this header is in [`src/lang.c`][49].

#### `lex.h`

This header defines the common items that both programs need for lexing.

The code associated with this header is in [`src/lex.c`][50],
[`src/bc_lex.c`][41], and [`src/dc_lex.c`][45].

#### `library.h`

This header defines the things needed for `bcl` that users should *not* have
access to. In other words, [`bcl.h`][30] is the *public* header for the library,
and this header is the *private* header for the library.

The code associated with this header is in [`src/library.c`][43].

#### `num.h`

This header is the API for numbers and math.

The code associated with this header is in [`src/num.c`][39].

#### `opt.h`

This header is the API for parsing command-line arguments.

It's different from [`args.h`][31] in that [`args.h`][31] is for the main code
to process the command-line arguments into global data *after* they have already
been parsed by `opt.h` into proper tokens. In other words, `opt.h` actually
parses the command-line arguments, and [`args.h`][31] turns that parsed data
into flags (bits), strings, and expressions that will be used later.

Why are they separate? Because originally, `bc` used `getopt_long()` for
parsing, so [`args.h`][31] was the only one that existed. After it was
discovered that `getopt_long()` has different behavior on different platforms, I
adapted a [public-domain option parsing library][34] to do the job instead. And
in doing so, I gave it its own header.

They could probably be combined, but I don't really care enough at this point.

The code associated with this header is in [`src/opt.c`][51].

#### `parse.h`

This header defines the common items that both programs need for parsing.

Note that the parsers don't produce abstract syntax trees (AST's) or any
intermediate representations. They produce bytecode directly. In other words,
they don't have special data structures except what they need to do their job.

The code associated with this header is in [`src/parse.c`][50],
[`src/bc_lex.c`][42], and [`src/dc_lex.c`][46].

#### `program.h`

This header defines the items needed to manage the data structures in
[`lang.h`][38] as well as any helper functions needed to generate bytecode or
execute it.

The code associated with this header is in [`src/program.c`][53].

#### `rand.h`

This header defines the API for the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).

The PRNG only generates fixed-size integers. The magic of generating random
numbers of arbitrary size is actually given to the code that does math
([`src/num.c`][39]).

The code associated with this header is in [`src/rand.c`][54].

#### `read.h`

This header defines the API for reading from files and `stdin`.

Thus, [`file.h`][55] is really for buffered *output*, while this file is for
*input*. There is no buffering needed for `bc`'s inputs.

The code associated with this header is in [`src/read.c`][56].

#### `status.h`

This header has a few things:

* Compiler-specific fixes.
* Platform-specific fixes.
* A list of possible errors that internal `bc` code can use.

There is no code associated with this header.

#### `vector.h`

This header defines the API for the vectors (resizable arrays) that are used for
data structures.

Vectors are what do the heavy lifting in almost all of `bc`'s data structures.
Even the maps of identifiers and arrays use vectors.

#### `version.h`

This header defines the version of `bc`.

There is no code associated with this header.

#### `vm.h`

This header defines the code for setting up and running `bc` and `dc`. It is so
named because I think of it as the "virtual machine" of `bc`, though that is
probably not true as [`program.h`][57] is probably the "virtual machine". Thus,
the name is more historical accident.

The code associated with this header is in [`src/vm.c`][58].

### `locales/`

This folder contains a bunch of `.msg` files and soft links to the real `.msg`
files. This is how locale support is implemented in `bc`.

The files are in the format required by the [`gencat`][59] POSIX utility. They
all have the same messages, in the same order, with the same numbering, under
the same groups. This is because the locale system expects those messages in
that order.

The softlinks exist because for many locales, they would contain the exact same
information. To prevent duplication, they are simply linked to a master copy.

The naming format for all files is:

```
<language_code>_<country_code>.<encoding>.msg
```

This naming format must be followed for all locale files.

### `manuals/`

This folder contains the documentation for `bc`, `dc`, and `bcl`, along with a
few other manuals.

#### `algorithms.md`

This file explains the mathematical algorithms that are used.

The hope is that this file will guide people in understanding how the math code
works.

#### `bc.1.md.in`

This file is a template for the markdown version of the `bc` manual and
manpages.

For more information about how the manpages and markdown manuals are generated,
see [`scripts/manpage.sh`][60].

#### `bcl.3`

This is the manpage for the `bcl` library. It is generated from
[`bcl.3.md`][61] using [`scripts/manpage.sh`][60].

For the reason why I check generated data into the repo, see
[`scripts/manpage.sh`][60].

#### `bcl.3.md`

This is the markdown manual for the `bcl` library. It is the source for the
generated [`bcl.3`][62] file.

#### `benchmarks.md`

This is a document that compares this `bc` to GNU `bc` in various benchmarks. It
was last updated when version `3.0.0` was released.

It has very little documentation value, other than showing what compiler options
are useful for performance.

#### `build.md`

This is the [build manual][14].

This `bc` has a custom build system. The reason for this is because of
*portability*.

If `bc` used an outside build system, that build system would be an external
dependency. Thus, I had to write a build system for `bc` that used nothing but
C99 and POSIX utilities, including barebones [POSIX `make`][74].

For more information about the build system, see the [build manual][14],
[`configure.sh`][69], and [`Makefile.in`][70].

#### `dc.1.md.in`

This file is a template for the markdown version of the `dc` manual and
manpages.

For more information about how the manpages and markdown manuals are generated,
see [`scripts/manpage.sh`][60].

#### `development.md`

The file you are reading right now.

TODO:

* Document all code assumptions with asserts.
* Document all functions with Doxygen comments.
* Compilers and their quirks, as well as warning settings on Clang.
	* My various `bc` aliases.
* My vim-bc repo.
* The purpose of every file.
* How locale works.
	* How locales are installed.
	* How the locales are used.
* Why generated manpages (including markdown) are checked into git.
* How all manpage versions are generated.
* Fuzzing.

	* Use `CC=afl-clang-lto` and `CFLAGS="-flto"`.

#### `header_bcl.txt`

Used by [`scripts/manpage.sh`][60] to give the [`bcl.3`][62] manpage a proper
header.

For more information, see [`scripts/manpage.sh`][60].

#### `header_bc.txt`

Used by [`scripts/manpage.sh`][60] to give the [generated `bc` manpages][79] a
proper header.

For more information, see [`scripts/manpage.sh`][60].

#### `header_dc.txt`

Used by [`scripts/manpage.sh`][60] to give the [generated `dc` manpages][80] a
proper header.

For more information, see [`scripts/manpage.sh`][60].

#### `header.txt`

Used by [`scripts/manpage.sh`][60] to give all generated manpages a license
header.

For more information, see [`scripts/manpage.sh`][60].

#### `release.md`

A checklist that I try to somewhat follow when making a release.

### `scripts/`

This folder contains helper scripts. Most of them are written in pure [POSIX
`sh`][72], but one ([`karatsuba.py`][78]) is written in Python 3.

For more information about the shell scripts, see [POSIX Shell Scripts][76].

### `src/`

### `tests/`

## POSIX Shell Scripts

There is a lot of shell scripts in this repository, and every single one of them
is written in pure [POSIX `sh`][72].

The reason that they are written in [POSIX `sh`][72] is for *portability*: POSIX
systems are only guaranteed to have a barebones implementation of `sh`
available.

There are *many* snares for unwary programmers attempting to modify
[`configure.sh`][69], any of the scripts in this directory, [`strgen.sh`][9], or
any of the scripts in [`tests/`][77]. Here are some of them:

1.	No `bash`-isms.
2.	Only POSIX standard utilities are allowed.
3.	Only command-line options defined in the POSIX standard for POSIX utilities
	are allowed.
4.	Only the standardized behavior of POSIX utilities is allowed.
5.	Functions return data by *printing* it. Using `return` sets their exit code.

In other words, the script must only use what is standardized in the [`sh`][72]
and [Shell Command Language][73] standards in POSIX. This is *hard*. It precludes
things like `local` and the `[[ ]]` notation.

These are *enormous* restrictions and must be tested properly. I put out at
least one release with a change to `configure.sh` that wasn't portable. That was
an embarrassing mistake.

The lack of `local`, by the way, is why variables in functions are named with
the form:

```
_<function_name>_<var_name>
```

This is done to prevent any clashes of variable names with already existing
names. And this applies to *all* shell scripts.
